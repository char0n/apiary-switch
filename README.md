# Proposal for enhancement of apiary SWITCH component

## Infra

I've used @facebookincubator/create-react-app to setup the initial repo and it provides
everything that we need to rapidly prototype any react concept.

## Approach

For the enhancement of the switch component  I've decided to use material design visual language
and all it's principles. I think it is a right direction for us to take this path if we  
want to introduce more modern and user friendly switch component with more features 
and better accessibility.

I've used material-ui as a reference implementation of material design in React. 
It allowed me to do rapid prototyping.
